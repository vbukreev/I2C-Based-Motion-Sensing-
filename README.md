# Embedded Motion Sensor System
## Overview
This project implements an I2C-based accelerometer system using an NXP MK66F18 microcontroller to detect real-time motion and orientation changes. It features interrupt-driven event handling, real-time I2C communication, and LED feedback mechanisms to signal motion variations. Designed for motion tracking, gesture recognition, and autonomous navigation, this embedded system demonstrates proficiency in sensor fusion, low-level firmware, and real-time embedded design.

## Features
✅ I2C Communication – Reads accelerometer data using an efficient protocol
✅ Motion & Orientation Detection – Tracks acceleration changes in X, Y, Z axes
✅ Interrupt-Driven LED Indications – Triggers visual alerts for motion detection
✅ Real-Time Processing – Handles continuous acceleration data with optimized firmware
