Developed an embedded system utilizing an I2C-based accelerometer (FXOS8700) interfaced with an NXP microcontroller (MK66F18) to detect real-time motion and orientation changes. Integrated low-level firmware to read acceleration data and implemented interrupt-driven mechanisms to trigger visual feedback via RGB LEDs. Designed robust I2C communication protocols and optimized sensor initialization routines to ensure reliable performance under dynamic conditions. The project demonstrates proficiency in embedded C, sensor fusion, and real-time system design, with applications in motion tracking, gesture recognition, and autonomous navigation systems.
